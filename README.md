# Object-Classifier
This project was written for my senior projects class at Grandview High School between 2015 and 2016. When given an image, it compares it to its stored database of processed images to try and identify the object in the image.

As a part of the class, we had to create a timeline with goals, and provide monthly journals on our progress. This information can be found here: https://arclightsoftworks.weebly.com/
